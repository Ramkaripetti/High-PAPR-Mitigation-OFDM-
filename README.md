# High-PAPR-Mitigation-OFDM-

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has emerged as a cornerstone technology for modern wireless communication systems, including 4G, 5G, and beyond. Its inherent advantages, such as high spectral efficiency, robustness to multipath fading, and ease of implementation, make it a preferred choice for many applications. However, the widespread adoption of OFDM is hindered by certain challenges, with the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) being one of the most critical issues.

A high PAPR results in significant power inefficiency in non-linear components, such as power amplifiers, leading to signal distortion and reduced system performance. To address this, several PAPR reduction techniques have been developed, including clipping and filtering, Partial transmit sequence (PTS), $\mu$ -law companding, and advanced approaches like Airy-based companding.

This study focuses on analyzing the impact of PAPR on OFDM signals, comparing various reduction techniques, and evaluating their performance under different fading channels with 8-PSK and 16-QAM modulation schemes. By leveraging MATLAB simulations, we assess the Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of PAPR, highlighting the suitability of each technique for real-world wireless communication systems.

This work aims to contribute to the understanding and optimization of PAPR reduction methods, paving the way for more efficient and reliable OFDM-based communication systems.
